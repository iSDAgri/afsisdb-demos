AfSIS DB Demos
==
This repository houses demonstrations of using AfSIS DB for fetching and analyzing soil chemistry data collected from Africa.

Background
==
[AfSIS DB](https://afsisdb.qed.ai) is a data management system for soil laboratory data, developed by [QED](https://qed.ai) for the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS). The key features that it provides include:

* Database storage for both relational and binary blob data, using PostgreSQL and S3, respectively.
* Web interface for uploading data, with support for server-side input validation.
* Web interface for searching and exporting data, including API support.
* Optional linking of laboratory data with field metadata collected using [Mobilesurvey](https://mobilesurvey.qed.ai).
* Access controls for groups and public vs. private data.

Because AfSIS DB runs on the web, it is cross-platform compatible. At the time of this writing, AfSIS DB now stores over 175,000 records of soil chemistry measurements unique to Africa, mostly from the AfSIS Phase II focus contries of Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria, and Ethiopia.

Installation
==
We use Jupyter notebooks to present these demonstrations cleanly with flavortext interspersed within code. If you do not wish to set up your local development environment for Jupyter notebooks, you can use the raw Python and R exports, and/or use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ to render an HTML version of these Jupyter notebooks in your browser.
